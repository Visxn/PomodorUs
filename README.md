# PomodorUs
The main idea for this app is to create an online Pomodoro app. It will have an study history where you can see your last study sessions and what have you done, also a real tme chat to chat with your friends.

## Motivation
We decided to choose this theme because for us it is hard to focus and start working in projects so we decided to improve the original idea in our way.
