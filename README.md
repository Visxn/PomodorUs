# PomodorUs
The main idea for this app is to create an online Pomodoro app that can be use to share your study sessions with your friends and also create a shared Pomodoro for study group sessions, so any friend can join whenever they want. It will have an study history where you can see your last study sessions and what have you done.

## Motivation
We decided to choose this theme because for us it is hard to focus and start working in projects so we decided to improve the original idea and it in our way
